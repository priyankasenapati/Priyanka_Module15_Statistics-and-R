# Priyanka_Module15_Statistics-and-R
In this module, Iâ€™m going to  apply my understanding in  statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. My  analysis will include visualizations, statistical tests, and interpretation of the results. All of my statistical analysis and visualizations will be written in the R programming language.
